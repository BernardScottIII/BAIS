# Bernard's Accounting Information System

A program which implements the processes taught in ACC 253: Financial Accounting at the University of Scranton.

## My Motivation

Early on in my Financial Accounting class, I noticed how procedural each aspect of the accounting cycle and how explicitly each step was defined. I saw this system as the perfect opportunity to code into a project, because it is something I am currently motivated to learn about, and it allows me to use skills I am already proficient in.

## Why I Built This Project

I built this project to get a better understanding of the accounting practices presented in my Financial Accounting class. Having this deep of an understanding of these practices, to the point where I can successfully apply it to a programming project, I feel is the most productive way to learn.

## What I've Learned

This project has taught me several things about accounting, Git, and Python. I have a great understanding of how to use Git, specifically knowledge of `.gitignore` and how adding, staging, committing, and pushing files works in Git.

My use of Python for this project allows me to practice programming using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), popular libraries like `os` and `datetime`, and reading/writing to files.

Most significantly of all, this project strengthened my knowledge of the accounting cycle. In its current iteration, this primitive program deals exclusively with the accounting cycle taught in ACC 253. However, I do aspire to add functionality which expands this program's capabilities and practical applications in the future.

## Installation Requirements and Instructions

### Python
The only prerequisite for running this project would be having at least `python 3.11.3` installed, which you can install by following [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or going to `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.
